	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for various different remapping
	  algorithms for storage devices. This option alone does not add any kernel
	  code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled;
	  only do this if you know what you are doing.

if NV_DEV

config NV_DEV_MAP
	tristate "Remapping Support"
	---help---
	  If you want to enable remapping of IOs beneath the block layer and/or
	  direct access from DAX. Say Y.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rem.
